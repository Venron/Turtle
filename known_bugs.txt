1. If the user is connected to one chat server, he can't connect in another window.
	If he selects the same server on the main window again, the Connect button must be grayed-out
2. If a server is offline / not reachable, let the user know instead of just letting nothing happen
3. If the user closes the window and doesn't exit with "--quit" somehow detect this situation
	and delete him from the user list.
4. Let the user know if the Authentification Server is not running


			FUTURE FEATURES
			---------------
			
1. Show all connected users at the right of the chat window.
2. Ping all servers (and authentification servers) at the main window, so the users
	can see which are online and which are not (Server / Authentification Server)
